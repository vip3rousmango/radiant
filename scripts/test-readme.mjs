/**
 * The Read me must only describe what is built.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS A RULE THIS PROJECT HAS ALREADY BROKEN. A guide that promises a
 * feature the app does not have had to be unshipped once, and today Tony had to
 * ask whether the Read me had been updated at all — it had not, and was missing
 * Home, conversation history, providers, text size and the whole model
 * catalogue. A guide nothing checks is a guide that drifts.
 *
 * So the claims that CAN be checked mechanically are checked here: names of
 * providers, makers, settings sections, and the model count. It cannot verify
 * prose, but it catches the failure that actually happens — a feature renamed or
 * removed in code while the Read me keeps describing it.
