# Radiant — read this first, every turn

## THE iPHONE APP — 1.0 (build 7) APPROVED by Apple, 2026-09-16

⚠️ **STILL READ APP STORE CONNECT BEFORE YOU TRUST THIS.** The heading above has
been wrong twice, once for nine days: it said "with Apple, build 2" while the
app had been REJECTED since 2026-08-25, and later said build 4 while the project
file had moved to 6. Approval does not make a written status reliable — whether
1.0 is *Pending Developer Release*, *Ready for Sale*, or has been superseded is
not recorded here and cannot be.

    https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps/6804891721/distribution/reviewsubmissions

**What got approved is build 7, and build 7 only.** It carries the consent sheet
(5.1.1(i)/5.1.2(i)), the rewritten privacy policy, and the subtitle "Open
models, on your phone". It does NOT carry anything after it.

### ⚠️ BEFORE ANYTHING AFTER BUILD 7 IS SUBMITTED: RE-ANSWER THE AGE RATING

`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` is **11**. Builds 8–11 are on TestFlight and contain
the Hugging Face search — an unrestricted search over Hugging Face's public MLX
models, with download. The 13+ rating on record was answered on the explicit
premise that "there is no field anywhere in the phone UI for pasting an
arbitrary Hugging Face repo, so the list is closed". **That premise is gone**,
and the word filter that briefly softened it was removed on Tony's instruction
(TG-454) and must not come back to make a rating easier.

So the questionnaire has to be answered again, honestly, for an open list before
build 8 or later goes to review. `docs/APP_STORE_LISTING.md` carries the
reference points (Locally AI ships an open list at 12+; expect to raise the
sexual-content and violence rows; 17+ is a fine outcome, an inaccurate
declaration is guideline 2.3 and costs a review cycle). Tony decides the
answers; only Tony can drive App Store Connect.

**A shipped 1.0 changes the rules for the next build.** While a version was
*Waiting for Review* you could remove it from review and swap the binary. Once
1.0 is out, build 8+ is an **update** — a new version number in App Store
Connect, its own review, and its own "what's new". The subtitle, screenshots and
description are tied to a version and change with that submission; promotional
text and review notes do not need a build.

**Anything to do with the submission: use the `app-store-review` skill**
(`.claude/skills/app-store-review/`, also installed at `~/.claude/skills`;
published at https://github.com/templetongroup/app-store-review — the repo is
the copy people install, so a change here goes there too). It is the whole
adventure — both rejections, the TestFlight false alarm, the privacy Publish
button, the two-button resubmit — turned into a protocol.

**The catalogue is published, not only compiled in.** `apps/ios/catalog.json` is
fetched at launch and applied over the built-in Swift array, so a broken row can
be corrected in minutes instead of a review cycle. It is GENERATED from that
array (`npm run catalog:export`), so the two cannot drift, and every failure
falls back to what shipped.

⚠️ **That also means a bad publish reaches every phone at once.** `npm run
catalog:publish` runs the export, then `scripts/catalog-check.py`, which probes
every repo and refuses on undeclared quantization, a size more than 10% off the
real blob total, or a 404. Do not copy catalog.json to the website by hand.
**Before any future submission, run `npm run catalog:check`.** It fails any repo
under ~1.2 bytes per parameter that declares no quantization — the Gemma 4
defect, which shipped because the old check only asked whether MLX implemented
the architecture.

Radiant is Tony's own coding harness: an Electron app wrapping a local node
server (`server/index.js`, port 5834) and a React UI (`src/`). It is a public,
MIT-licensed repo, signed and notarized, and it auto-updates from GitHub
Releases. Work on `master`.

## Written is not shipped

**Every change closes all three of these, in the same turn:**

1. **Git** — committed with a real message, and pushed. Tony runs the packaged
   app, not the dev server, and other agents work from other checkouts. An
   uncommitted fix looks exactly like no fix: on 2026-08-22 six corrected files
   sat in the working tree while he tested the release and reported the bug as
   still broken.
2. **The in-app Read me** — the `GUIDE` array in `src/components/Settings.jsx`
   (Settings → "Read me"). Standing rule from Tony: *"you MUST update that
   readme when features are added or changed. end users deserve that."* Write it
   for someone using the app: what they can now do, plain language, US spelling.
3. **Linear** — team **The Templeton Group** (TG), project **Radiant**. Ship
   something → its issue goes to Done, or create one already Done. Spot a
   problem you are not fixing → file it.

**This is automatic, not a question to ask.** Tony has standing authorization:
run the `ship-sync` agent at the end of any turn that changed behavior.

Run the objective half and fix whatever it flags:

```bash
node scripts/ship-check.mjs
```

It verifies committed / pushed / Read-me-kept-current / tagged. Or hand the
whole job to the **`ship-sync`** agent (runs on Haiku, cheap) — it loops until
all three are actually verified rather than merely attempted.

## Releasing

A fix Tony cannot run is not shipped. When a change is user-facing:

```bash
npm version <next> --no-git-tag-version && npm run build
git add -A && git commit -F <message-file>
npx electron-builder --mac          # signs + notarizes; takes a few minutes
git tag v<next> && git push origin master --tags
gh release create v<next> release/Radiant-<next>-arm64.dmg \
  release/Radiant-<next>-arm64.dmg.blockmap \
  release/Radiant-<next>-arm64-mac.zip \
  release/Radiant-<next>-arm64-mac.zip.blockmap \
  release/latest-mac.yml --title "v<next>" --notes-file <notes>
```

All five assets matter — `latest-mac.yml` is what the in-app updater reads.
Confirm with `spctl -a -vv -t install release/mac-arm64/Radiant.app` ("accepted,
Notarized Developer ID"). Commit messages and release notes with apostrophes or
backticks break shell heredocs — write them to a file and use `-F` / `--notes-file`.

## Every release also updates the website

The download page is part of shipping, not a follow-up:

```bash
cp release/Radiant-<v>-arm64.dmg /tmp/radiant.dmg
gh release upload v<v> /tmp/radiant.dmg --clobber      # stable-named asset
```

Then in `~/Projects/templeton-group-dev-website`: set
`showcase/radiant/version.json` to the new version and size, and update the
`js-version` / `js-size` fallbacks in `showcase/radiant/index.html` so a failed
fetch cannot show a stale number. Push to `main` (auto-deploys in ~10s) and
verify the live URL.

⚠️ The DMG is gitignored — 124 MB, past GitHub's file limit — so it never
travels through git. The page links to
`releases/latest/download/radiant.dmg`, which is why that stable-named asset
has to be uploaded on every release. Skipping it is how the site once
advertised 0.6.74 while 0.6.100 was current.

## Sharp edges

- **Model calls go through `server/net.js` (`modelFetch`), never bare `fetch`.**
  Node's fetch is undici with 300 s headers/body timeouts; a local 27B can be
  silent longer than that while it loads and reads a prompt, and the round
  died with `TypeError: terminated`. `scripts/test-slow-model.mjs` refuses a
  bare fetch on a provider round. Cancellation is the turn's AbortSignal.
- **An empty round is nudged once, then halted with a reason** (providers.js,
  `emptyRounds`); `finish_reason: length` is announced; `<tool_call>` written
  as text is parsed. `scripts/test-empty-turn-live.mjs` drives all four shapes
  through the real server against a scripted provider.

- **Voice conversations are opt-in and the key is server-side.** `src/voice.js`
  (WebRTC to GPT-Live from the renderer) and `server/voice.js` (creates the
  session with an OpenAI *API key* — a ChatGPT sign-in cannot; `voiceKey()`
  takes any key on the OpenAI roster). Client delegation only: the thinking is
  always Radiant's own turn. Nothing runs unless `settings.voice.enabled`.
  `scripts/test-voice.mjs` covers everything short of a microphone; the
  in-app Browser pane blocks the mic, so an end-to-end check needs the
  packaged app.

- **Two icons, not one.** `build/icon.png` + `build/icon.icns` is the Mac Dock
  icon and copies AiOS's geometry (body 0.896 of canvas, swirl 0.678, measured
  off `~/Projects/aios-claude/mac/icon-1024.png`). The web/iOS set —
  `public/favicon.png`, `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/icon-{192,512}.png`,
  `src/assets/logo-mark.png` — is **full-bleed and signed off; do not change it.**
  `scripts/make-icon.py` writes only the Mac icon unless you pass `--web`.
- **Colors live under `:root[data-mode=…]`**, applied from the config. A device
  that has not signed in never gets a config, so anything that renders before
  auth must work with the mode restored from localStorage in `index.html`.
- **Remote devices** authenticate with a token (Settings → Devices & sharing),
  held in an httpOnly cookie so a phone stays signed in. Loopback is always
  allowed, so test the gate over the Tailscale address, never `127.0.0.1`.
- **`~/.radiant/config.json` has one writer, the server.** Window geometry lives
  in `~/.radiant/window-state.json` precisely to avoid racing it.
- The updater stages a download in `~/Library/Caches/radiant-updater/pending`
  and installs it on quit. It must always hold the newest release or the user
  gets walked up one version at a time.

## The iPhone app

`apps/ios` is a real Capacitor shell around a **separate** UI in `src/mobile`.
It shares no styling with the desktop build: `App.jsx` lazy-imports
`mobile/Phone.jsx` only when `window.Capacitor.isNativePlatform()` is true, so
`mobile.css` and the whole tree stay out of the Mac bundle's entry chunk. Keep
it that way — check `vite build` still emits a separate `Phone-*.js` chunk.

**Every iOS build goes to every device.** Standing instruction from Tony
(2026-09-10): *"when you create new builds to the ios version, i want you to
update it on all devices."* A dev install only changes when someone pushes a
new one to that device, so a build that lands on one phone leaves the others
on last week's code with no way to tell. One command does the whole job —
web bundle, sync, build once, install on every paired device that answers:

```bash
scripts/ios-install-all.sh
```

It lists the devices that did not answer (off, asleep, not on this network)
at the end; run it again when they are. Devices today: iPhone 17 Pro Max,
iPad Pro 11, iPad mini (A17 Pro). All are on the paid team's profile, which
lasts a year — not the seven days a free Apple ID gets.

⚠️ `npx cap sync ios` REWRITES `CapApp-SPM/Package.swift` and drops the MLX and
HuggingFace packages (TG-221); the next build fails with "unable to resolve
module dependency: 'Cmlx'". The script restores the file from git after every
sync. If you sync by hand, `git checkout -- apps/ios/ios/App/CapApp-SPM/Package.swift`.

**Building it takes two non-obvious flags.** Plain `xcodebuild` fails twice:

```bash
cd apps/ios && xcodebuild -project ios/App/App.xcodeproj -scheme App \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -configuration Debug CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
  -skipPackagePluginValidation -skipMacroValidation build
```

- Without `-skipPackagePluginValidation`, it dies on "Validate plug-in CudaBuild
  in package mlx-swift" — an unapproved build-tool plugin, normally a GUI trust
  prompt.
- Do **not** pass `-sdk iphonesimulator`. It forces the host toolchain to that
  SDK and MLX's macro target then cannot resolve SwiftSyntax.

**A Debug build's code is not in `App.app/App`.** That is a 40 KB launcher stub;
the real binary is `App.app/App.debug.dylib` (~79 MB). Verify a Swift change
landed by checking the dylib, not the stub:

```bash
strings -a "$APP/App.debug.dylib" | grep -c downloadProgress
```

### Before you touch the download path

```bash
./scripts/test-download-math.sh
```

Download progress broke FOUR times in production — flatlining at 2%, starting at
100%, showing no number at all, and reporting a stopped download as a finished
model. Every one was pure arithmetic or a folder name. None of it needed MLX, a
simulator, or a phone. But it lived inside a plugin that cannot even initialise
in the Simulator, so the only way to run it was to install a build on Tony's
phone and ask him to watch — which is how he ended up being the test harness for
two lines of division.

That logic now lives in `apps/ios/…/plugins/DownloadMath.swift`, which is pure:
values in, values out, no filesystem, no network, no UIKit. `LocalModels.swift`
calls it and holds no copy. Each shipped bug has a named case in
`scripts/test-download-math.swift`.

Run it before and after any change to downloading, and add a case the moment
something breaks again — before fixing it. If a change to the download path
cannot be expressed as a failing case there, that is a signal the logic is in the
wrong place, not that the test is unnecessary.

**MLX cannot run in the iOS Simulator — the app aborts.** Anything that touches
the model engine (download, generate) dies in `mlx::core::metal::Device::Device()`
with SIGABRT the moment it initialises Metal; the simulator has no GPU MLX will
accept. The app then vanishes and the simulator falls back to whatever was
behind it, which looks like a UI bug and is not one. Read the real reason in
`~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/App-*.ips`.

So the simulator is good for **layout, navigation, first run and accessibility
only**. Any claim about downloading or generating has to be made on a physical
iPhone — build with `-destination 'id=<udid>'`, `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=5VY66S6G3M`,
`-allowProvisioningUpdates`, then `xcrun devicectl device install app`. Do not
write "verified in the Simulator" about a model actually running.

**Previewing the phone UI without a device.** The native gate means a browser
shows the desktop app. Serve `dist/` with a script that defines
`window.Capacitor` — `isNativePlatform`, `getPlatform`, `nativePromise`,
`addListener` — before the bundle loads, and the phone UI renders at 375×812.
Match the real contracts or you will chase ghosts: sizes are **`sizeGB`** (not
bytes), disk comes from `Device.getInfo().realDiskTotal/realDiskFree`, and the
download events are **`downloadStarted` / `downloadProgress` / `downloadDone` /
`downloadFailed`**. Note a hidden browser pane suspends rAF and clamps
`setTimeout` to ~1s, so screen-push animations never settle and stubbed
progress loops crawl — neither is an app bug.

- **Type on the phone: two rules that have each cost a whole review cycle.**
  1. `-apple-system` and `ui-monospace` are system-font **keywords**. Declare
     them literally — the stack lives on `.is-native body` and everything else
     inherits it. Never put one behind a custom property; `grep -r -- '--rx-font'
     src/mobile` must come back with only the comment that says so.
  2. **`-apple-system-body` is 17px in the app and 16px in mobile Safari** on the
     same simulator — Safari steps web system text down one notch. So the
     `--rx-dt` Dynamic Type probe divides by **17**, and any measurement taken in
     the browser preview above will be one notch small and wrong for the build.
     Body-scale roles use the `font: -apple-system-*` shorthands directly (they
     resolve to UIKit's real 17/17/15/13/12/11 here, which is free Dynamic Type);
     large title, title 2, title 3 and the mono readouts are typed out and scaled
     by `--rx-dt`.

- **Every control in `src/mobile` is a `div`**, so `usePress` carries the
  semantics: `role`, `tabIndex`, `aria-label`, and Enter/Space. Use it for
  anything tappable and pass `label` for an icon-only control. Do not
  reintroduce `outline: none` on `:focus-visible` — it never matches a tap, and
  a phone can have a keyboard, Full Keyboard Access or Switch Control.

## Rating work — the star system

`.claude/skills/star-system/` is vendored from
https://github.com/templetongroup/star-system. Run it when Tony says "rate this"
or "run the star system" after a deliverable, and follow it exactly: ask for the
1–5 rating, never assign one yourself, never argue with it, ask fewer questions
the higher it is, log the round in `ratings.md`, and loop until it reaches 4+.

`ratings.md` at the repo root is the record. Read its **Gold Standards** section
before building anything in an area that already has one — that is the bar for
that area, set by Tony, and new work is measured against it.
