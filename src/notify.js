/**
 * Notifications — the one way Radiant can reach you when it is not the window
 * you are looking at.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT COULD NOT, AT ALL. There was no `Notification` anywhere in this app:
 * not in the renderer, not in the main process. A turn that failed, a turn that
 * finished after ten minutes of tool use, and a turn sitting on an approval
 * prompt were all equally silent — the only way to find out was to go and look.
 * Tony: "still having lots of failures within chats and no notification at all."
 *
 * Two rules keep this from becoming the other kind of problem:
 *
 *   1. NOTHING WHILE YOU ARE WATCHING. A notification about the window you are
 *      already reading is noise, and macOS will happily show it anyway — the
 *      check is ours to make. Focus, not just visibility: a Radiant window
 *      behind Xcode is still a window you are not reading.
 *   2. ONE PER CHAT. The tag is the session id, so a finish replaces the
 *      approval prompt that preceded it instead of stacking under it.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE TWO DECISIONS ARE PURE FUNCTIONS, AND ON PURPOSE. "Do we notify?" and
 * "what does it say?" are the only parts that can be wrong in a way you would
 * notice, and both of them sit behind an OS call that cannot run in a test.
 * Same lesson as the phone's download math: keep the arithmetic out of the
 * thing that needs a device. scripts/test-notify.mjs runs them.
