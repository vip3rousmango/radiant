/**
 * "Radiant is a Templeton Technologies product." — and now it goes somewhere.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT WAS DEAD TEXT IN FOUR PLACES. The byline is on the welcome screen, at
 * the foot of Home, under the Read me and under About, and in every one of them
 * it named the company and gave no way to find it. Tony, 2026-09-17: it "should
 * be clickable and take people to the templetontech.com website."
 *
 * One component for all four, so the next screen that carries the byline cannot
 * get a different URL, a different tap target, or no link at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE WHOLE SENTENCE IS THE TARGET, NOT THE TWO WORDS. "Templeton
 * Technologies" inside a caption-sized line is a target a few millimetres tall;
 * Apple's own floor is 44pt and a caption is not close. The line takes the tap
 * and the company name is what is tinted, so the affordance reads where the
 * eye expects it and the finger still has somewhere to land.
