/**
 * Read me — the phone's, not the Mac's.
 *
 * The Mac app's guide (the GUIDE constant in src/components/Settings.jsx)
 * describes agents, MCP servers, model providers and a terminal, none of which
 * exist here. Tony: "About/Read Me obviously need to reference features in
 * this, not the mac app." So this is written from scratch against what the
 * iPhone app actually does today.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT MUST ONLY DESCRIBE WHAT IS BUILT. A guide that promises a feature the
 * app does not have is worse than no guide — that mistake has already been made
 * once in this project and had to be unshipped. When something lands, add it
 * here in the same change.

      'The gear, the back arrow, the ⋯ menu, the download circle, the tick, the send arrow and the rest are now the same symbols iOS itself draws, at the same weights, so they sit next to the system\u2019s own icons without looking a little off. They follow the text color, so they read correctly in light and dark.'

    body: [
      'Home is where the app opens: the logo, a greeting, and one button to start talking. Under it, Recent lists the conversations you have had, newest first — tap one to pick it up where you left off, or Delete to remove it.',

      `Every model is labeled for THIS ${deviceWord()}. Green runs well. Amber runs, but close to the limit — expect it to be slow, and to reload when you switch apps. Red is not expected to load at all. The label is guidance, not a lock: you can still download a red model and try it.`,
      `That label is about memory, not storage, and they are different questions: a phone can easily have room for a file it cannot then run. Bigger models answer better and use more battery. Qwen 3 1.7B is a good place to start on any recent ${deviceWord()}.`,
      `The panel above the list shows what this ${deviceWord()} gives ${BRAND.productName} to work with. It is less than the phone's total memory, because iOS limits how much any single app may use.`

    title: 'Finding more on Hugging Face',
    body: [
      `The Models page ends with a search box. Type a name — “llama 3.2”, “qwen 4bit”, “gemma” — and ${BRAND.productName} searches Hugging Face for models in the format it runs. Each result is checked before you download it: whether the engine can load that kind of model, whether its weights are what its description says, and whether it fits the memory of this ${deviceWord()}. Then it gets the same green, amber or red label as the built-in list, or a plain reason it cannot run. The keyboard scrolls the search box up clear of itself, so you can see what you are typing and the Search button.`,
      `Download puts it beside the built-in models with the same turning swirl, byte count, stop, chat and remove. Remove only appears on a model the search added; a result that is already in the built-in list is managed from its own shelf. The search is not filtered: anything published in a format ${BRAND.productName} can run will show up, including uncensored and abliterated builds. These are models other people have made, and a model with its safety training removed will say anything — read its page on Hugging Face if you want to know what it is.`

      'Start writing a message, leave the chat to do something else, and it is still in the box when you come back. Nothing is sent until you tap the arrow.',
      `That matters most when there is no model yet. A conversation opens whether or not anything can answer it, and it now says so above the box, with a button to go and choose one. Write your message first if you like — go pick a model or start a download, and your sentence is waiting for you on this ${deviceWord()} when you return.`

      'Swipe a row left in Recent Sessions and you get two things: Archive and Delete. Archive puts a conversation under an Archived heading at the foot of the list, folded away until you tap it.',
      'That is worth knowing because the phone keeps the last forty conversations and quietly drops the oldest to make room. An archived one is never dropped, so archiving is how you keep something rather than just tidy it away.'

      `Settings → Color carries the same theme names as the Mac app. The Allegretto theme uses the agency blue accent on iPhone; its full warm-paper, ink, and soft-pink surface palette belongs to the desktop workspace. Templeton uses a sage-green accent. The color runs through buttons, the glow behind the logo, and the ring while a model downloads.`,
      `Settings → Text size sets the size of everything on top of whatever you have chosen in iOS Settings, so you can make ${BRAND.productName} larger without changing every other app.`
