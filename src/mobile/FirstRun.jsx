/**
 * FirstRun — the first five seconds of Radiant, and the only screen that is
 * allowed to be a piece of design rather than a piece of iOS.
 *
 * THE HANDOFF IS THE TRICK. The launch image (Splash.imageset, built by
 * scripts/make-ios-splash.py) is frame one of this screen: same ground, same two
 * glows, same lockup at the same size. iOS shows the
 * PNG, this mounts underneath it, and the entrance plays from exactly where the
 * static image left off. There is no seam, so the app looks alive from the
 * instant the icon is tapped.
 *
 * NOTHING LOOPS. Tony: "no animation should run continually." Every animation
 * here runs once and holds its final frame; the glows settle and the halo does
 * not breathe. A phone about to run a language model gets no permanent rAF.

          carry what the web splash carries.

          ⚠️ THE MARK KEEPS ITS OWN COLORS. Every other brand element here is
          masked so it follows the user's accent — that is right for Radiant's
          own swirl, and wrong for this: it is a different company's logo, and
          recoloring it green-to-whatever is exactly the thing you do not do to
          someone's mark. It is an <img>, composited as drawn.

          It works on this ground because it is the SAME ground: the site sets
          oklch(0.15 0.018 262) behind it and so does this screen, so the mark
          is being used in the condition it was approved in. */}
