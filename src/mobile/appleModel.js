 * Apple's on-device model — the thing that answers before anything is downloaded.

 * ⚠️ THIS EXISTS TO REMOVE A TOLL GATE. Radiant's own models are 0.7–4 GB, and
 * until one finishes the app can do nothing at all: New chat is disabled and
 * Home says there is no model. Apple's is already on the phone, needs no
 * download, no key and no network, so a fresh install can answer the first
 * message and the download becomes a choice.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS NOT ALWAYS THERE. iOS 26 or later, a phone that supports Apple
 * Intelligence, and the user having switched it on. The reason is carried
 * through verbatim from the native side because each one has a different fix —
 * a settings toggle, a wait, or the phone itself.
