/**
 * ModelsScreen — the root. The shell owns the scroller, the large title and the
 * nav bar, so this file starts at the hero and ends at the storage line.
 *
 * Information architecture IS the argument here: the gauge owns the top of the
 * screen in every state, the catalog is one ordinary inset grouped list, and
 * On-device is the
 * product; the Mac is one tap away and weighs nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ FOUR THINGS ON THIS SCREEN HAVE BEEN ROUND-TRIPPED. Read before changing:
 *
 * 1. THE ROW IS NAME OVER BLURB, AND THE SIZE LEADS THE BLURB.
 *    It has moved three times; do not move it a fourth without measuring.
 *    It sat under the download glyph in a trailing column once — where it stole
 *    enough width that three of five blurbs truncated mid-word ("and r…",
 *    "on p…", "with h…") and, being a variable-width string under a
 *    fixed-width glyph, left the row's right margin ragged down the list. That
 *    is gone for good: the trailing column is the arrow.down.circle alone,
 *    which is the iCloud idiom Apple ships with no label.
 *
 *    It was then taken out of the row ENTIRELY, on the grounds that leading the
 *    blurb made every blurb wrap and rows measure 84.9pt. Tony, browsing the
 *    catalog: "models have no sizes. no way to tell whats small." He was right,
 *    and the 84.9pt finding no longer held: measured against all 44 real rows
 *    at 393pt, 33 of 36 catalog blurbs ALREADY wrap to two lines on their own,
 *    the tallest row is 81pt with the size and 81pt without it, and exactly
 *    three rows gain a line. The weight is worth three lines.
 *
 *    ⚠️ IT DOES NOT GO ON THE NAME LINE. That looks like the free space and is
 *    not: the headline is 309pt, and "Nemotron 3 Nano 4B" + "2.2 GB · Runs
 *    well" wraps, with three more names clearing the edge by under 30pt.
 *
 *    ⚠️ MEASURE IN THE HARNESS, NOT THE STUB. The five-model stub carried
 *    SHORTENED blurbs ("Meta's." for Llama 3.2 3B) and made this layout look
 *    fine when the real strings behaved differently. harness/bridge.js now
 *    parses LocalModels.swift, so what renders there is what renders on glass.
 *
 * 2. THERE IS NO LEADING GAUGE ON A CATALOG ROW. Five of them taught the mark
 *    in the first two seconds — in theory. Measured, the three-ring spiral has
 *    no legibility budget under about 26pt: at 29 the radial gap between the A
 *    and B strokes is 1.3pt and the whole thing renders as a smudge. Five
 *    smudges down the left edge is worse than no mark. The gauge appears at
 *    96 in the hero, 26 in a downloading row's accessory (where it is moving,
 *    which is what makes it legible), 120 on the sheet and 128 on first run.
 *
 * 3. THE HERO IS A LEFT-ALIGNED VERTICAL STACK ON THE 20pt LAYOUT MARGIN.
 *    It has been centred (two competing alignment axes against a left-aligned
 *    list) and it has been a horizontal gauge-then-text row, which put the mark
 *    at an optical 28pt and its label at 100pt while the title, the cards and
 *    the footer all sat at 20 — three left edges, and the hero aligned to none
 *    of them. Vertical gives the screen exactly two: 20pt for everything at
 *    screen level, 36pt for text inside a card. The gauge is optically aligned,
 *    not box-aligned: its outermost stroke sits 12.15% of the box in from the
 *    left, so the box carries a negative margin of that fraction.
 *
 * 4. THE STORAGE LINE IS DRAWN EVEN WITH NOTHING DOWNLOADED. It used to hide
 *    until the first model landed, which left the launch screen with a dead
 *    lower third and no statement of the product argument. With no segments it
 *    draws no track — an empty 4pt rail reads as a stuck download — and states
 *    the free space instead.
