/**
 * Home — somewhere to arrive, not a list of files to manage.
 *
 * The app used to open onto Models: a catalogue of things to install. Tony:
 * "I feel like theres no Home Screen on this app. it feels wrong." He was
 * right. Nothing greeted you, nothing showed what you had been doing, and
 * starting a conversation meant going through an inventory screen first.
 *
 * So: who you are talking to, what you were saying, and one obvious way on.
 * Models moved to where model management belongs — a screen you visit when you
 * want to change something, not the front door.
