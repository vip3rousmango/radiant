/**
 * Choose a folder (or a file), without typing a path.
 *
 * ⚠️ A BARE TEXT FIELD IS NOT A CHOICE. Both the Graph view and the loop composer
 * shipped asking for an absolute path and nothing else — fine if you already know
 * it, useless otherwise, and there is no reason for it: the Mac has a folder
 * picker and Radiant is already allowed to open one. Tony: "are we expecting
 * users to type in a folder/file path? this is not user friendly at all."
 *
 * ⚠️ THE PICKER OPENS ON THE MAC RUNNING RADIANT, WHICH IS ALSO WHERE THE PATH
 * HAS TO EXIST. That is the same machine, so this is correct — and it is why the
 * browser build cannot have it. A phone on Tailscale is talking to the Mac; a
 * picker there would return a path from the phone. So the field stays, as the
 * fallback rather than as the interface, and it says which machine it means.
