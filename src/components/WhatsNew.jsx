/**
 * What arrived while you were not looking.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT RECORDS THE VERSION EVEN WHEN IT SHOWS NOTHING. A fresh install is shown
 * nothing — but if it did not write the version down, the NEXT update would replay
 * the entire history at somebody who had used the app once.
 *
 * ⚠️ PER DEVICE, NOT PER ACCOUNT. localStorage, not the config: the config is
 * shared between the Macs pointed at one Radiant, so storing it there would mean
 * reading the release notes on the laptop and never seeing them on the desktop that
 * also updated. It also has to work before any config arrives.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS DISMISSED BY ONE OBVIOUS CONTROL. This appears unbidden, in front of
 * whatever you sat down to do, so Escape, the backdrop and the button all close it,
 * and it never comes back for that version.

  // two classes to this rule's one, so `position: fixed` lost and the backdrop
  // took a column of its own. The sidebar was shoved from x 0 to x 1152 while the
  // dialog was open and snapped back when it closed, and the dialog centred itself
  // in the leftover space rather than the window — 124px off. Tony: "the read me
  // looks clumsy on the left. when i click got it. the nav bar shifts over to the
  // right. looks bad."
  //
  // Raising specificity would have fixed this one modal and left the trap set for
  // the next. An overlay belongs outside the layout it covers.
