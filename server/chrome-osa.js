/**
 * Driving the Chrome the user is actually signed into.
 *
 * ⚠️ CDP CANNOT REACH IT, AND THAT IS PERMANENT. Chrome 136 removed the ability to
 * start the DEFAULT profile with --remote-debugging-port. Measured on Tony's Mac,
 * Chrome 152, 2026-09-03: the flag is on the running Chrome's command line and
 * NOTHING is listening on 9222. It is not an error and there is no warning — the
 * port is simply ignored. So every attach attempt fails, Playwright falls back to
 * LAUNCHING a browser, and the agent gets a stranger's Chrome with no tabs, no
 * extensions and no logins. That is why the agent kept reporting that it could not
 * see the page and blaming macOS permissions: "why cant you get browser/computer
 * control right."
 *
 * AppleScript can reach it, and does today. Verified against his 86 open tabs:
 * window and tab enumeration, the active tab's URL, and `execute javascript`
 * returning "DNS Management" from the GoDaddy tab he had open.
 *
 * ⚠️ ARGUMENTS GO THROUGH argv, NEVER THROUGH STRING CONCATENATION. A page's URL or
 * a snippet of JavaScript embedded into an AppleScript source string is an escaping
 * problem with three nested quoting contexts (shell, AppleScript, JS), and it breaks
 * on the first apostrophe, backslash or newline — which is to say, on real web
 * pages. `osascript -e '…on run argv…' <arg>` with execFile passes them as real
 * arguments, so there is nothing to escape. scripts/test-chrome-osa.mjs feeds it
 * quotes, backslashes, newlines and emoji and requires them back byte-for-byte.
