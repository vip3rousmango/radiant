// 2026-08-23: through `tailscale serve`, /api/config returned 200 with no
// token, from another machine. Radiant runs shell commands, so that is a
// full compromise of the host, and with `tailscale funnel` it would be open
// to the internet.

// site the user happened to be browsing read /api/config and drive /api/chat
// with no token and no click. Origin is the only thing that separates them, so
// it is checked here and nowhere else has to think about it.
//
// ⚠️ THE EXPECTED ORIGIN IS BUILT AT BOOT, NEVER READ OFF THE REQUEST. The first
// version of this gate compared Origin against the Host header — but both are
// sent by the client, so it only asked whether the request agreed with itself.
// Any name an attacker controls satisfies that: serve a page from
// attacker.com:5834 with a one-second DNS record, flip it to 127.0.0.1, and the
// page is same-origin with Radiant. Origin equals Host, the socket is loopback,
// and the tab gets /api/share (the token) and a login shell on /term. Measured:
// `curl -H 'Host: attacker.example:5834' -H 'Origin: http://attacker.example:5834'`

 * silently: the machine demonstrably had Serve running (its https address
 * answered 401 in 45ms) and the panel still offered a Wi-Fi address, because the
 * binary was not where I guessed or could not be executed from the packaged app.
 * A detector that reports "no" when the answer is "yes" is worse than none — it
 * sent him to an address that cannot work from a phone.
 *
 * Two steps, neither of which needs a binary:
 *  1. REVERSE-DNS the tailnet address. MagicDNS publishes PTR records, so
 *     100.64.118.54 resolves to dev-mbp.tail1207dc.ts.net with a plain lookup.
 *  2. ACTUALLY FETCH IT. Deriving the name proves nothing about whether Serve is
 *     in front of it — so the URL is only offered once it has answered. 401 is
 *     the expected answer here and counts: it means Radiant is behind it and

  // ⚠️ iCloud IS ALWAYS OFFERED ON A MAC, DETECTED OR NOT.
  // This used to require com~apple~CloudDocs to stat successfully, and when it
  // did not — Tony's work MBA, iCloud Drive plainly switched on — the feature
  // fell back to "choose a folder", which is a question the user should never
  // have to answer. A Mac's iCloud Drive is ALWAYS at this path; if the
  // directory is missing, setDataDir creates it, and its write probe rejects
  // the folder if it is not actually usable. Verification was never what made
  // this safe, so it should not be what makes it unavailable.
  // ⚠️ NO WARNING BASED ON A FILESYSTEM GUESS. A note reading "turn on iCloud
  // Drive if it is off" was attached whenever ~/Library/Mobile Documents did
  // not stat — and it fired on a Mac with iCloud Drive plainly switched on,
  // telling the user to fix something that was not broken. That is the SECOND
  // wrong guess about the same machine from a stat call that evidently cannot
  // be trusted there, most likely because a managed Mac denies the read.
  //
  // So do not guess. Offer iCloud, and let ticking the box produce a REAL
  // answer: setDataDir creates the folder and write-probes it, so a genuine
  // failure arrives as a specific error at the moment it happens, instead of
  // speculative advice on a screen where nothing has been attempted yet.
  //
  // ⚠️ ALL OF THAT IS ABOUT A MAC, AND ONLY HOLDS ON ONE. "A Mac's iCloud Drive
  // is ALWAYS at this path" is the whole argument for offering it unverified,
  // and off a Mac the premise is simply false — there is no iCloud Drive to
  // create, so setDataDir could not produce the real answer that makes offering
  // it safe. Offering it anywhere else is the failure this reasoning rejects,
  // not an instance of it: an option that cannot work, presented as if it could.
