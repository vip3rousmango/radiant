/**
 * Gemini Live as a second voice for a chat — the server's half of
 * src/voice-gemini.js, and the twin of server/voice.js.
 *
 * Tony asked whether Google's real-time audio is a better option than GPT-Live
 * and then said "add it now". It is not a swap: the two APIs share nothing.
 *
 *   GPT-Live   WebRTC from the renderer, an SDP offer traded for an answer,
 *              JSON on a data channel, and a first-class DELEGATION event that
 *              hands every real request back to Radiant.
 *   Gemini     A stateful WebSocket, raw PCM in and out, and no delegation
 *              concept at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ SO THE DELEGATION IS BUILT OUT OF A TOOL. Radiant's whole proposition for
 * voice is that the live model does the talking and Radiant's own turn does the
 * thinking — same model, same tools, same approvals as typing. Gemini has no
 * delegation, so it is given exactly ONE function, ask_radiant, and told that
 * anything real goes through it. A toolCall then means the same thing a
 * delegation means, and src/voice-gemini.js raises it through the same
 * onDelegate callback. Gemini's function calling is asynchronous, so it can
 * keep speaking while Radiant works, which is the one thing this buys us.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE KEY STAYS ON THIS SERVER. A browser must not hold a Gemini API key,
 * so the key mints a short-lived EPHEMERAL TOKEN (POST /v1beta/auth_tokens)
 * and only that reaches the renderer — Google's own rule for client-to-server
 * use, and Radiant's rule for every key it holds.
 *
 * ⚠️ OPTIONAL, like the other one. Nothing here runs unless
 * settings.voice.enabled is on, and a missing key is a sentence rather than a
 * 4xx.
