/**
 * Creating a GPT-Live session for a chat — the server's half of src/voice.js.
 *
 * The renderer sends an SDP offer; this posts it to OpenAI with the project key
 * and returns the answer. The key never reaches the renderer, which is OpenAI's
 * own rule for browser clients and Radiant's rule for every key it holds.
 *
 * ⚠️ CLIENT DELEGATION, ALWAYS. The other mode has OpenAI run a Responses
 * model as the backend, which would put the thinking on OpenAI regardless of
 * which model the chat uses. Client mode hands every real request back to
 * Radiant's own turn — same tools, approvals, and model as typing would get.
 *
 * ⚠️ OPTIONAL. This refuses unless settings.voice.enabled is true, so a person
 * who never turned it on cannot be billed by a stray button, and it says what
 * is missing (the setting, the key) in a sentence rather than a 4xx.
