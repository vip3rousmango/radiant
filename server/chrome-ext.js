/**
 * The other end of the Radiant browser extension.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE EXTENSION DIALS OUT AND WE ANSWER. A service worker cannot listen, and
 * Radiant should not be able to reach into a browser that never asked for it. So
 * the socket is opened by the extension, on loopback, and every request travels
 * back down the connection it arrived on. Closing Chrome, or uninstalling, unplugs
 * it — there is nothing to revoke.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY REQUEST CARRIES AN ID AND A DEADLINE. One socket multiplexes all the
 * tools, so replies must be matched to their callers rather than assumed to arrive
 * in order; and a page that never finishes loading must not hang the turn forever
 * with no explanation — the exact shape of failure this app has shipped repeatedly.
 * Timeouts reject with a sentence a person can act on.
