/**
 * Who else is using this folder.
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO MACS ON ONE SHARED FOLDER IS A DATA HAZARD ALLEGRETTO ONLY EVER MENTIONED
 * IN PASSING. Settings says "One Mac at a time. Two copies of Allegretto writing to
 * the same folder at once will overwrite each other" — in a hint, inside a
 * collapsed section, which nobody reads before it matters. Nothing detected it,
 * so the first sign was work quietly disappearing.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THIS DOES NOT BLOCK. Refusing to start would lock someone out of their
 * own chats to protect them from a risk they may be perfectly happy to take —
 * reading on one Mac while working on the other is fine, and a stale lock from a
 * crash would be indistinguishable from a live one. Rule 12 cuts the other way
 * here: say the true thing, name the other Mac, let the person decide. The cost
 * of being wrong about a lock must never be "you cannot reach your work".
 *
 * ⚠️ THE HEARTBEAT HAS TO OUTLAST iCLOUD, NOT THE PROCESS. A beat written on one
 * Mac is not visible on the other until iCloud carries it across, which is
 * seconds and occasionally much longer. A threshold tuned to process liveness
 * would have each Mac confidently declaring the other dead. BEAT_MS is short so
 * the record is fresh; STALE_MS is deliberately six beats, so it takes a real
 * absence rather than one slow sync to call a lock abandoned.
