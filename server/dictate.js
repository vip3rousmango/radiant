/**
 * Dictation: Apple's on-device speech recognition, streamed to the browser.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE HELPER MUST BE A CHILD OF RADIANT.APP, AND RADIANT.APP MUST CARRY THE
 * USAGE STRINGS. Measured on 2026-09-03: the same signed helper, with the same
 * NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription embedded in its own __TEXT,__info_plist,
 * is killed by TCC when it is spawned from a shell —
 *
 *   namespace TCC: "This app has crashed because it attempted to access
 *   privacy-sensitive data without a usage description."
 *
 * — and runs to "authorized" when the responsible process is a real bundle whose
 * Info.plist has the key. Putting it in a bundle of its own did not help; being
 * launched by something that has the key did. That is why the two strings are in
 * package.json's mac.extendInfo, and why breaking them would not fail a build —
 * it would crash the microphone at the moment somebody tries to speak.
 *
 * Only one at a time: a second microphone tap on the same device is how you get
 * two half-transcripts. Closing the response kills the child, and closing the
 * child's stdin is what stops it — that survives the server being killed, which
 * a SIGTERM handler does not.
