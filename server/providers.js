// kept whole and re-sent on EVERY round. 135k tokens a request, 30 rounds a
// turn, 29.8M tokens over the chat. "how can this chat be so long. i barely did
// anything."

// So old results are folded down on the way OUT to the model. Storage is
// untouched and the transcript still shows everything — this changes what the
// request carries, not what happened. Recent results stay whole, because that

// matches on an exact BYTE PREFIX. A boundary of `length - KEEP_WHOLE` advances
// by one on every round, so a message sent whole in round N is sent trimmed in
// round N+7 — the prefix diverges there, and the automatic message-tail
// breakpoint finds nothing to read. Folding would then be paying 1.25x to
// rewrite the cache every round to save characters it had already cached at
// 0.1x, which is worse than not folding at all.
//
// Quantizing the boundary to a step fixes it: the folded prefix is byte-
// identical for STEP consecutive rounds, so the cache is written once and read
// for the rest of them. The cost is keeping up to KEEP_WHOLE + STEP - 1 messages
